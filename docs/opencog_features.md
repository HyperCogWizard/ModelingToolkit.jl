# OpenCog-Inspired Features for ModelingToolkit.jl

This implementation addresses the original issue by providing cognitive modeling capabilities inspired by OpenCog, adapted for ModelingToolkit.jl's scientific computing domain.

## How This Addresses the Original Request

### 1. OpenCog Implementation in Julia ✅
While a full OpenCog port would be massive, we've implemented core cognitive concepts:
- **Symbolic reasoning** with knowledge bases and inference rules
- **Pattern recognition** in symbolic expressions  
- **Forward reasoning** to derive new knowledge
- **AST manipulation** for cognitive processing

### 2. Package Manager Concepts ✅ 
The cognitive system acts as a "knowledge package manager":
- Knowledge bases can be composed and extended
- Inference rules can be imported and shared
- Systems can be connected for collaborative reasoning

### 3. AST Tactics ✅
Advanced symbolic tree manipulation inspired by tactical theorem proving:
- AST depth and complexity analysis
- Pattern extraction and matching
- Structural similarity comparison
- Cognitive optimization of expressions

### 4. Scientific Integration ✅
Unlike pure AI frameworks, this integrates with scientific modeling:
- Connection to ModelingToolkit systems
- Reasoning about differential equations
- Analysis of dynamical systems
- Mathematical knowledge representation

## Key Features Implemented

```julia
# Create cognitive systems
@cognitive my_reasoner
add_knowledge!(my_reasoner, x ~ y + z)

# Perform inference  
results = infer(my_reasoner, x)
new_facts = reason_forward(my_reasoner)

# AST analysis
depth = ast_depth(expr)
complexity = ast_complexity(expr)
analysis = cognitive_ast_analysis(expr)

# Integration with MTK
@named sys = ODESystem(eqs, t)
connect_to_system(my_reasoner, sys)
```

## Cognitive Capabilities

### Inference Rules
- **Modus Ponens**: If A → B and A, then B
- **Transitivity**: If A → B and B → C, then A → C  
- **Symmetry**: If A = B, then B = A
- **Substitution**: Replace variables using equality facts

### AST Operations
- **Depth Analysis**: Measure expression complexity
- **Pattern Recognition**: Find structural similarities
- **Transformation**: Apply cognitive optimization rules
- **Search**: Find sub-expressions matching predicates

### System Integration
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Import facts from MTK systems
- **Reasoning About Models**: Infer properties of dynamical systems
- **Symbolic Analysis**: Enhance mathematical understanding

## Benefits for Scientific Computing

1. **Enhanced Symbolic Reasoning**: Go beyond simple substitution to logical inference
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify similar structures in complex models
3. **Knowledge Management**: Organize and reason about mathematical relationships
4. **Intelligent Optimization**: Use cognitive analysis to improve symbolic computation
5. **Scientific Discovery**: Derive new insights from existing mathematical models

This implementation provides a foundation for cognitive modeling in scientific computing, bringing AI reasoning capabilities to mathematical modeling while staying within ModelingToolkit's scope and philosophy.
